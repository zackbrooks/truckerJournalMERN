## The Trucking Journal

The Trucking Journal is a full stack web application. It is meant to make a trucker's life on the road easier by helping them with their personal notes.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS, Material UI

This is a personal project for me. As a former truck driver, I know how much of a pain it can be to keep track of your notes on customers and brokers. You have a countless number of notebooks filled with pages. It's very difficult to find a specific entry when you have so many pages and countless notebooks to look through. With those things in mind, I wanted to make a simple, but sleek application. React is the perfect tool for that, especially coupled with Material UI. As a foundation, I know I wanted users to be able to list notes for companies and brokers. I implemented the use of modals to lessen the number of pages the user has to go through while using the application. The color scheme I used was a nice cool/chill color in my opinion. The backend is pretty straightforward. NodeJS with express for routing. Everything is stored on MongoDB. Authentication use JWT and cookies.

## Future Plans/Optimizations

I have a few ideas to implement in the future. Those include adding a search input, making a journal/entry shareable, and offline availability. As a user's notes grows, it will be difficult to scroll to find a specific entry. A search input would make that easier. While trucking, you come across a number of people. Being able to share notes on a broker or company would be a nice feature to help out other truckers. Trucker's often find themselves in the middle of nowhere, with no access to the internet. Being able to access the information will be very important in situations like that.

## Lessons Learned

For state management I usually utilize Redux Toolkit. This time I decided to use React's Context API. It was interesting and I can see the appeal of using it. I think I will continue to use Redux Toolkit, Zustand, and React Query to handle state management.
